See the top level README for more information.

As described in the top level readme, copy rockbox.ipod to the .rockbox
directory on your ipod and use menu+select to reboot.

This is a simple show text on the lcd panel program.  Eventually
scrolling text.

The display is really 138x110 but I think the controller supports
160x128 as the big brother ipods (classic) had, the ones before the
mini.  So we pretend to have a 160x128 even though we cant see all of it.

You can probably figure out this is just writing bitmap data, pixels,
ones and zeros so isnt really limited to text or this isnt really some
lcd text mode thing, just filling the screen with bytes and the bytes
happen to be raw font data.

Eventually I will read the manual for the lcd controller and hopefully
replace the ipodlinux/rockbox code.  It isnt very complicated.
