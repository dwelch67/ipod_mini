As described in the top level readme, copy rockbox.ipod to the .rockbox
directory on your ipod and use menu+select to reboot.

Derived from lcd1 and ipodlinux code, this reads the ipod keyboard (wheel)
and prints out the raw values.  Looks like the wheel itself goes from 0x00
to 0x5F and there are discretes for the buttons.

Wheel value       (wheel_value>>16)&0xFF;
Select button     wheel_value & 0x0100
FastFoward Button wheel_value & 0x0200
Rewind Button     wheel_value & 0x0400
PlayPause Button  wheel_value & 0x0800
Menu Button       wheel_value & 0x1000
